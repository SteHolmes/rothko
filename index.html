          <p>Mark Rothko, born Markus Yakovlevich Rothkowitz, was an American artist of the mid-20th century. Rothko did not personally subscribe to any art movement, but he is generally identified as an abstract expressionist.</p>
          <p>By the 1950's Rothko had matured into his signature style; colourfield paintings. Unlike some of his fellow abstract expressionist artists of the day, he had rejected the physical, sometimes violent methods of paint application in favour of a more spiritual and contemplative form of colour appreciation. These new paintings were composed of several large rectangular blocks of colour place mostly horizontally on the canvas. Sometimes vivid and latterly quite subdued, these paintings conveyed human emotion in all its splendour; from joy and ecstasy to grief and depression.</p>
          <p>Today his work can be found in museums all over the world and he has become the poster child for modern art and freedom of expression.</p>
